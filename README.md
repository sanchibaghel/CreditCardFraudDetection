# CreditCardFraudDetection

## Overview
This data science project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection using a publicly available dataset. Credit card fraud is a critical issue in the financial industry, and this project seeks to build a robust and accurate model to identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

The project includes the following key steps:

### Data Collection: 
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Detection). It contains a collection of credit card transactions with labeled fraud and non-fraud cases.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The data undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values (if any), standardizing transaction amounts, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Building: 
Two machine learning models are implemented for comparison:
    Random Forest Classifier
    Decision Tree Classifier

### Model Evaluation: 
The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. These metrics provide insights into how well the models distinguish between fraud and non-fraud cases.

### Feature Importance Analysis: 
For the Random Forest model, an analysis of feature importance is conducted to identify which features have the most significant impact on fraud detection.

### Comparison Report: 
A comparison report is generated to showcase the differences in performance between the Random Forest and Decision Tree models. This report includes metrics for both models and allows for an informed evaluation of their effectiveness.

### Visualizations: 
Throughout the project, visualizations are used to better understand the data distribution, feature importance, and transaction patterns.

## Results
The project results, including classification reports, visualizations, and comparisons between the Random Forest and Decision Tree models, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Conclusion
This credit card fraud detection project provides insights into building and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection. The comparison between Random Forest and Decision Tree models helps determine which approach performs better for this specific task.
